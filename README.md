## The John Roberts Parrot
##### Ben Kim

This is the repository carrying a project for DIGS 20006. In it, I am attempting to replicate and understand the mind of John Roberts and his judicial rulings and opinions. 

Within this repository you will find:
- README.md: This file
- cases: A folder containing .txt files of opinions written by John Roberts.
- metadata.csv: A csv file containing information about each case
- the_parrot.ipynb: A jupyter notebook file that contains the code to replicate John Roberts
- .gitgnore: Used to gitignore venv and my secret key
