Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of the Court.
Respondents are Virginia drivers whose licenses were suspended due to their failure to pay court fines or costs. The drivers sued the Commissioner of the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles under 42 U. S. C. §1983, arguing that the Virginia statute requiring suspension of their licenses was unconstitutional. The District Court preliminarily enjoined the Commissioner from enforcing the statute. But before the case reached final judgment, the Virginia General Assembly repealed the challenged law, rendering the action moot. The question presented is whether the drivers are “prevailing part[ies]” who qualify for an award of attorney’s fees under §1988(b).
I
Until recently, a Virginia statute directed the state courts to suspend the license of any driver who failed to pay “any fine, costs, forfeitures, restitution, or penalty lawfully assessed against him” for violation of a federal, state, or local law. The suspension remained in force until the amount due was paid in full or the driver entered into a court- approved payment plan. Va. Code Ann. §46.2–395(B) (2016) (repealed 2020). Virginia drivers—whose licenses were suspended under the law and who asserted that they could not afford to pay the fines or costs or keep up with a payment plan—sued the Commissioner of the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles on their own behalf and on behalf of a putative class. The drivers alleged that the statute facially violated the Due Process Clause by “failing to provide sufficient notice or hearing to any driver before license suspension” and violated both the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses “as applied to people who cannot afford to pay due to their modest financial circumstances.” First Amended Class Action Complaint in Stinnie v. Holcomb, No. 3:16−cv−00044 (WD Va., Sept. 11, 2018), ECF Doc. 84, pp. 2−3; see also id., at 37−43. The drivers sought declaratory relief, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, and attorney’s fees under 42 U. S. C. §1988(b).
In December 2018, the District Court granted a preliminary injunction, prohibiting the Commissioner from enforcing the statute against the drivers or future class members. See Stinnie v. Holcomb, 355 F. Supp. 3d 514, 520 (WD Va. 2018). The court explained that the drivers had made “a clear showing that [they were] likely to succeed” on their procedural due process claim, though it noted that they need not “establish a certainty of success.” Id., at 527 (quoting Di Biase v. SPX Corp., 872 F.3d 224, 230 (CA4 2017)). The court also determined that the remaining preliminary injunction factors—the risk of irreparable harm, the balance of equities, and the public interest—weighed in the drivers’ favor. Stinnie, 355 F. Supp. 3d, at 532; see Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008). The Commissioner did not appeal the grant of the preliminary injunction.
In April 2019, about four months before a bench trial was scheduled to begin, the Commissioner moved to dismiss as moot or, in the alternative, stay the case. See Stinnie v. Holcomb, 396 F. Supp. 3d 653, 656 (WD Va.). The Virginia General Assembly had recently adopted Budget Amendment No. 33, which “eliminate[d] the suspension of drivers’ licenses for failure to pay court fines and costs through July 1, 2020, but [did] not repeal §46.2–395.” Ibid. The Commissioner represented that the General Assembly was likely to repeal the law during the next legislative session. The District Court granted a stay, reasoning in part that doing so served the interests of judicial economy and enabled the court to avoid “weigh[ing] in on sensitive constitutional questions about license suspension schemes about which other courts ha[d] disagreed.” Id., at 660.
In April 2020, the Virginia General Assembly repealed §46.2–395 and required the permanent reinstatement of licenses suspended under the law. See 2020 Va. Acts ch. 965. As a result, the parties agreed that the action had become moot and stipulated to dismissal. The drivers, however, asserted that they were entitled to attorney’s fees under §1988(b), so the parties jointly requested that the court retain jurisdiction to resolve that dispute. The District Court declined to award attorney’s fees, following Smyth v. Rivero, 282 F.3d 268 (CA4 2002). See Stinnie v. Holcomb, 2021 WL 2292807 (WD Va., June 4, 2021). In Smyth the Fourth Circuit held that a plaintiff awarded a preliminary injunction is not a “prevailing party” within the meaning of §1988(b). 282 F. 3d, at 277. A Fourth Circuit panel affirmed, again relying on Smyth. Stinnie v. Holcomb, 37 F. 4th 977 (2022). Judge Harris concurred, suggesting that the Circuit may wish to reconsider that precedent. Id., at 983.
The Fourth Circuit did so, rehearing the case en banc and overturning its decision in Smyth. Stinnie v. Holcomb, 77 F. 4th 200 (2023). It observed that Smyth had become the “outlier” among the courts of appeals. 77 F. 4th, at 209. It reasoned that some preliminary injunctions “provide enduring, merits-based relief that satisfies all the requisites of the prevailing party standard.” Id., at 203. And it explained, in light of this Court’s decision in Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council, that a plaintiff could no longer prevail on a preliminary injunction for reasons that “had virtually nothing to do with the merits of her claim.” 77 F. 4th, at 208−209; see Winter, 555 U. S., at 20 (clarifying that a finding of likely success on the merits is a prerequisite to preliminary injunctive relief). Finally, it noted that Congress had enacted §1988(b) in the interest of facilitating the redress of civil rights grievances. 77 F. 4th, at 210.
The en banc court articulated a new standard: “When a preliminary injunction provides the plaintiff concrete, irreversible relief on the merits of her claim and becomes moot before final judgment because no further court-ordered assistance proves necessary, the subsequent mootness of the case does not preclude an award of attorney’s fees.” Ibid. Applying that standard, the en banc court vacated and remanded the case to allow the District Court to determine a reasonable fee. Id., at 218. Judge Quattlebaum dissented, arguing that a preliminary injunction does not constitute a judicial decision on the merits and that a fee award on the basis of such an injunction therefore conflicts with both the text of §1988(b) and this Court’s precedents. See id., at 225, 227, 231.
We granted certiorari to determine whether the term “prevailing party” in §1988(b) encompasses a party who is awarded a preliminary injunction, if the case becomes moot before the court reaches a final judgment. 601 U. S. ___ (2024).

Since 1796, this Court has maintained that “the Judiciary itself would not create a general rule, independent of any statute, allowing awards of attorneys’ fees in federal courts.” Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society, 421 U.S. 240, 249 (1975) (citing Arcambel v. Wiseman, 3 Dall. 306 (1796)). The principle that “the prevailing litigant is ordinarily not entitled to collect a reasonable attorneys’ fee from the loser” became known as the “American Rule.” Alyeska Pipeline, 421 U. S., at 247. Federal courts may depart from this rule only when “there is express statutory authorization” to do so. Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 429 (1983).
In 1976, Congress adopted the Civil Rights Attorney’s Fees Awards Act. 90Stat. 2641. The law provides that, in actions brought under certain civil rights statutes—including 42 U. S. C. §1983—“the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney’s fee as part of the costs.” §1988(b). The question is whether the drivers in this case qualify as “prevailing part[ies]” within the meaning of §1988(b).
A
When interpreting a statute, we begin with the text. As we have previously recognized, the phrase “prevailing party” in §1988(b) is a “legal term of art.” Buckhannon Board & Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Dept. of Health and Human Resources, 532 U.S. 598, 603 (2001). We assume that “when Congress ‘borrows terms of art in which are accumulated the legal tradition and meaning of centuries of practice, it presumably knows and adopts the cluster of ideas that were attached to each borrowed word.’ ” United States v. Hansen, 599 U.S. 762, 774 (2023) (quoting Morissette v. United States, 342 U.S. 246, 263 (1952)).
At the time §1988(b) was adopted, Black’s Law Dictionary defined “prevailing party” as the party “who successfully prosecutes the action or successfully defends against it.” Black’s Law Dictionary 1352 (rev. 4th ed. 1968). It explained that prevailing party status “does not depend upon the degree of success at different stages of the suit, but whether, at the end of the suit, or other proceeding, the party who has made a claim against the other, has successfully maintained it.” Ibid.; accord, Ballentine’s Law Dictionary 985 (3d ed. 1969). A prevailing party, in other words, is “[t]he party ultimately prevailing when the matter is finally set at rest.” Black’s Law Dictionary 1352.
Preliminary injunctions, however, do not conclusively resolve legal disputes. In awarding preliminary injunctions, courts determine if a plaintiff is likely to succeed on the merits—along with the risk of irreparable harm, the balance of equities, and the public interest. Winter, 555 U. S., at 20. “The purpose of a preliminary injunction is merely to preserve the relative positions of the parties until a trial on the merits can be held,” University of Tex. v. Camenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395 (1981), and “to balance the equities as the litigation moves forward,” Trump v. International Refugee Assistance Project, 582 U.S. 571, 580 (2017) (per curiam). “Crafting a preliminary injunction is an exercise of discretion and judgment, often dependent as much on the equities of a given case as the substance of the legal issues it presents.” Id., at 579. Such relief is also “customarily granted on the basis of procedures that are less formal and evidence that is less complete than in a trial on the merits.” Camenisch, 451 U. S., at 395. As a result, we have previously cautioned against “improperly equat[ing] ‘likelihood of success’ with ‘success’ ” and treating preliminary injunctions as “tantamount to decisions on the underlying merits.” Id., at 394.
The transient nature of preliminary injunctions is most apparent when a court reaches a different conclusion upon full consideration of the merits. For example, in one of our more recent cases interpreting §1988, Sole v. Wyner, 551 U.S. 74, 78–79 (2007), protesters sought a preliminary injunction against a state regulation of beach attire in order to assemble nude in the form of a peace sign. The day after the complaint was filed, the District Court held a hearing and granted the preliminary injunction. Id., at 79. The preliminary injunction permitted the protest to occur and thus preserved the participants’ rights until a final determination could be made on the merits of their claim. Ultimately, however, the court declined to award a permanent injunction, ruling that the regulation was no more burdensome than necessary to protect the public. Id., at 80−81.
Because preliminary injunctions do not conclusively resolve the rights of parties on the merits, they do not confer prevailing party status. A plaintiff who secures a preliminary injunction has achieved only temporary success at an intermediary “stage[ ] of the suit.” Black’s Law Dictionary 1352. It cannot yet be said that he will “ultimately prevail[ ] when the matter is finally set at rest” or that he will have “successfully maintained” his claim “at the end.” Ibid. And external events that render a dispute moot do not convert a temporary order designed to preserve the status of the parties into a conclusive adjudication of their rights.
The Fourth Circuit en banc was persuaded that “Winter’s stringent merits requirement” avoided the “risk” that “a plaintiff may prevail, and thus be entitled to fees, based on a preliminary injunction that had virtually nothing to do with the merits of her claim.” 77 F. 4th, at 209. But it is not enough that Winter guarantees a preliminary injunction award has at least something to do with the merits. The plaintiff must succeed on the merits.
B
This conclusion is consistent with our precedents interpreting §1988(b). We have held that, for the purposes of §1988(b), a plaintiff “prevails” when a court grants enduring judicial relief that constitutes a “material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties.” Texas State Teachers Assn. v. Garland Independent School Dist., 489 U.S. 782, 792−793 (1989). For example, we have ruled that a plaintiff may qualify as a “prevailing party” based on an award of nominal damages, Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U.S. 103, 112 (1992), or a final victory on a material even if not predominant claim, Texas State Teachers Assn., 489 U. S., at 791−793. By contrast, a party does not qualify as a “prevailing party” when a court of appeals overturns directed verdicts and discovery orders entered against him, Hanrahan v. Hampton, 446 U.S. 754, 756 (1980) (per curiam), or when a court enters a declaratory judgment but does not modify the defendant’s behavior toward the plaintiff, Rhodes v. Stewart, 488 U.S. 1, 3−4 (1988) (per curiam) (holding that no fees were available under §1988 when the judgment afforded no relief to the plaintiff due to mootness).
Two of our more recent decisions highlight the requirements that the change in legal relationship be judicially sanctioned and enduring. In Buckhannon Board & Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources, we rejected the “catalyst theory”—the theory that a plaintiff may receive attorney’s fees under §1988(b) when he “achieves the desired result because the lawsuit brought about a voluntary change in the defendant’s conduct.” 532 U. S., at 601; see id., at 600. In that context, we explained that the plaintiff was not a “prevailing party” because there had been “no judicially sanctioned change in the legal relationship of the parties.” Id., at 605. The defendant’s voluntary actions “lack[ed] the necessary judicial imprimatur.” Ibid. We were not persuaded that §1988(b) “authorizes federal courts to award attorney’s fees to a plaintiff who” filed a “potentially meritless lawsuit” and “reached the ‘sought-after destination’ without obtaining any judicial relief.” Id., at 606 (quoting id., at 634 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting)).
In Sole v. Wyner, we decided that “a plaintiff who gain[ed] a preliminary injunction after an abbreviated hearing, but [was] denied a permanent injunction after a dispositive adjudication on the merits,” did not qualify as a “prevailing party” within the meaning of §1988(b). 551 U. S., at 77; see id., at 78. That plaintiff, we explained, “gained no enduring change in the legal relationship” between herself and the defendants. Id., at 86 (emphasis added; alterations and internal quotation marks omitted). Although we left open the question presented in this case, see ibid., we described the plaintiff ’s success at the preliminary injunction stage as “a transient victory at the threshold of an action,” a “fleeting success” that “did not establish that [the plaintiff] prevailed on the gravamen of her plea for injunctive relief,” one “tentative [in] character, in view of the continuation of the litigation to definitively resolve the controversy,” id., at 78, 83, 84.
We recognize that neither opinion resolves this case, but our holding today follows naturally from these precedents. In Sole, we established that the change in the legal relationship between the parties must be “enduring.” Id., at 86. In Buckhannon, we established that the change must be “judicially sanctioned.” 532 U. S., at 605. Today, we establish that the enduring nature of that change must itself be judicially sanctioned. A plaintiff who wins a transient victory on a preliminary injunction does not become a “prevailing party” simply because external events convert the transient victory into a lasting one. Rather, a plaintiff “prevails” under the statute when a court conclusively resolves a claim by granting enduring judicial relief on the merits that materially alters the legal relationship between the parties.[1]*
C
The rule we establish today also serves the interests of judicial economy. A straightforward, bright-line rule is easy to administer, reducing the risk of “a second major litigation” over attorney’s fees. Cf. Hensley, 461 U. S., at 437. The drivers, however, suggest that our rule promotes simplicity at the cost of creating perverse incentives. They fear that government defendants who have lost at the preliminary injunction stage will strategically moot litigation rather than risk a fee award were they to ultimately lose on the merits. See Brief for Respondents 42−47. We found similar concerns to be “entirely speculative” when we rejected the catalyst theory in Buckhannon, 532 U. S., at 608. We reiterate that such risk could arise in only a small number of contexts. After all, if a plaintiff “has a cause of action for damages, a defendant’s change in conduct will not moot the case.” Id., at 609. And even if the plaintiff seeks only injunctive relief, voluntary cessation of the challenged conduct does not moot an action “unless it is ‘absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.’ ” Ibid. (quoting Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 189 (2000)); see also FBI v. Fikre, 601 U.S. 234, 241 (2024) (characterizing this burden as “formidable” (quoting Friends of the Earth, 528 U. S., at 190)). A survey asking public interest organizations to self-report on the impact of Buckhannon does not change our minds. See post, at 17−18 (Jackson, J., dissenting).
It is Congress’s job to craft policy and ours to interpret the words that codify it. “Atextual judicial supplementation is particularly inappropriate when . . . Congress has shown that it knows how to adopt the omitted language or provision.” Rotkiske v. Klemm, 589 U.S. 8, 14 (2019). Congress has shown that it knows how to empower courts to award attorney’s fees to plaintiffs who have enjoyed some success but have not prevailed in a judgment on the merits. In the Freedom of Information Act, for example, Congress authorized courts to assess attorney’s fees when a complainant has “substantially prevailed,” even if through “a voluntary or unilateral change in position by the agency.” 5 U. S. C. §552(a)(4)(E). If Congress determines that the rule we adopt today is unwise, it may amend the statutory language—just as it enacted §1988(b) itself in response to our decision in Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society. 421 U.S. 240; see Hensley, 461 U. S., at 429. Until then, “it is of course our job to apply faithfully the law Congress has written.” Henson v. Santander Consumer USA Inc., 582 U.S. 79, 89 (2017).
D
The drivers urge the opposite conclusion, but we find their arguments unpersuasive.
First, the drivers, joined by the dissent, argue that the dictionary definitions support them. But they assume that the favorable resolution of a dispute is tantamount to success on a claim in a legal action. A “prevailing party,” however, is defined in the latter sense—one who “successfully prosecutes the action,” who has “made a claim” against another and “has successfully maintained it.” Black’s Law Dictionary 1352.
Second, the drivers and dissent contend that §1988(b) was enacted against a historical backdrop that favored awarding interim costs at equity, including for preliminary injunctions. See Brief for Respondents 19−21. The dissent in Alyeska Pipeline similarly invoked “the well-established power of federal equity courts to award attorneys’ fees when the interests of justice so require.” 421 U. S., at 272 (Marshall, J., dissenting). We rejected that argument, however, and determined that the American Rule supplied the default rule at law and equity, subject to narrow historical exceptions not at issue here. See id., at 241, 247 (majority opinion).
Next, the drivers argue that the availability of fees while litigation is ongoing suggests that §1988(b) includes no finality requirement. See Brief for Respondents 40−42. The dissent likewise points to our statement in Buckhannon that a “ ‘prevailing party’ is not intended to be limited to the victor only after entry of a final judgment following a full trial on the merits.” 532 U. S., at 607 (quoting H. R. Rep. No. 94–1558, p. 7 (1976)); see post, at 15. We have recognized that “Congress contemplated the award of fees pendente lite in some cases.” Hanrahan, 446 U. S., at 757. For example, we have explained that, in school desegregation cases, “many final orders may issue in the course of the litigation” because injunctive relief “must prove its efficacy . . . over a period of time and often with frequent modifications.” Bradley v. School Bd. of Richmond, 416 U.S. 696, 723 (1974). Our decisions simply indicate that attorney’s fees may be awarded when conclusive, enduring judicial relief is meted out on an incremental basis. Hanrahan, 446 U. S., at 758 (“Congress intended to permit the interim award of counsel fees only when a party has prevailed on the merits of at least some of his claims.”). Key language on which the dissent relies—our statement that a party prevails when it “succeed[s] on any significant claim affording it some of the relief sought,” including relief on the merits pendente lite—explained our rejection of the “central issue test,” which would have required a party to prevail on its central claim in order to be awarded attorney’s fees. Texas State Teachers Assn., 489 U. S., at 791; see post, at 4. It did not refer to preliminary relief.
The availability of fees following the entry of a court- ordered consent decree is fully consistent with the rule we announce today. A consent decree reflects the parties’ own resolution of the merits, but it is approved and given force of law by the court. See Firefighters v. Cleveland, 478 U.S. 501, 523 (1986). Violation of a consent decree is enforceable by a citation for contempt. Ibid. So a consent decree is like a final judgment in the relevant ways: It conclusively resolves the claim, bears a judicial imprimatur, and may grant enduring relief that materially alters the legal relationship between the parties. That is why “[w]e have only awarded attorney’s fees where the plaintiff has received a judgment on the merits or obtained a court-ordered consent decree.” Buckhannon, 532 U. S., at 605 (citation omitted). For its part, the dissent conflates preliminary judicial relief that becomes irreversible by way of mootness with relief that is permanent by virtue of a judicial order. See post, at 10−11. That a preliminary order may sometimes “function[ ] . . . like” a final order due to external circumstances, see post, at 11 (citation omitted), is not dispositive of the nature of the order.
*  *  *
Section 1988(b) permits courts to award attorney’s fees to a “prevailing party.” A party “prevails” when a court conclusively resolves his claim by granting enduring relief on the merits that alters the legal relationship between the parties. Critically, both the change in relationship and its permanence must result from a judicial order. A preliminary injunction, which temporarily preserves the parties’ litigating positions based in part on a prediction of the likelihood of success on the merits, does not render a plaintiff a “prevailing party.” Nor do external events that moot the action and prevent the court from conclusively adjudicating the claim. Because the drivers in the present case gained only preliminary injunctive relief before this action became moot, they do not qualify as “prevailing part[ies]” eligible for attorney’s fees under §1988(b).
The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
